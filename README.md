The challenge is fairly simple: given a file containing one word per line, print out all the combinations
 of words that are anagrams; each line in the output contains all the words from the input that are anagrams 
  each other. For example, your program might include in its output:
  ```
  kinship pinkish
  enlist inlets listen silent
  boaster boaters borates
  fresher refresh
  sinks skins
  knits stink
  rots sort
  ```
