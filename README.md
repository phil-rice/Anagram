The challenge is fairly simple: given a file containing one word per line, print out all the combinations
 of words that are anagrams; each line in the output contains all the words from the input that are anagrams 
  each other. For example, your program might include in its output:
  ```
  kinship pinkish
  enlist inlets listen silent
  boaster boaters borates
  fresher refresh
  sinks skins
  knits stink
  rots sort
  ```
  
  For added programming pleasure, find the longest words that are anagrams, and find the set of 
  anagrams containing the most words (so “parsley players replays sparely” would not win, having 
  only four words in the set).
